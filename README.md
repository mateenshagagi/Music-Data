# Spotify and Youtube Music Data Comparison

This project aims to determine the top albums in each music metric (explained in the dataset) and compares the characteristics of successful songs on Spotify vs Youtube. I chose to work with music data as I speant 10% (according to Spotify statistics) of all minutes last year listening to music, it is a huge component in my life that I am deeply passionate about. Lastly, I will create a song reccomendation system using k-means clustering.
